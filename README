This plugin for Atlassian Confluence, provides a thin wrapper around
MathJax <http://www.mathjax.org/>. MathJax is an open source
JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all modern
browsers.

Two macros for Confluence are provided: mathinline and
mathdisplay. They both accept mathematics in Latex notation and output
either an inline equation (within the main text) or a displayed
equation (separate from the main text, typically centered on the
page). AMSmath extensions for Latex are also enabled.

The src/main/resources/mathjax directory contains a pristine copy of
MathJax v1.1a. It can be updated as necessary to newer versions of
MathJax as and when they are released, provided that the configuration
mechanism does not change from version to version.
