====== Confluence-MathJax ======

This plugin for Atlassian Confluence
<http://www.atlassian.com/Confluence>, provides a thin wrapper around
MathJax <http://www.mathjax.org/>. MathJax is an open source
JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all modern
browsers.

Two macros for Confluence are provided: mathinline and
mathdisplay. They both accept mathematics in Latex notation and output
either an inline equation (within the main text) or a displayed
equation (separate from the main text, typically centered on the
page). AMSmath extensions for Latex are also enabled.

Help is provided in the Confluence Notation Guide under the Advanced
Formatting tab.

===== Example usage =====

A couple of simple examples:
  * {mathinline}\frac{x}{y}{mathinline} a nice fraction.
  * And to get a nice integral, simply use {mathdisplay}\int_{-\infty}^\infty 
      \mbox{e}^{-x^2} \mbox{d}x.{mathdisplay}

===== Downloading =====

At the moment this plugin definitely works for Atlassian Confluence
3.4-4.1 and possibly for earlier versions (I haven't tested below
3.4). If you install in Confluence 3.x, it might complain that some
dependencies are not fulfilled. This is normal and due to the fact that
the macro format has changed with Confluence 4.x.

You can grab the source code from GitHub
<https://github.com/db9052/confluence-mathjax>.

The plugin binary should appear on <http://plugins.atlassian.com> soon (search
for MathJax). It can also be downloaded from the downloads section at GitHub
<https://github.com/db9052/confluence-mathjax/downloads>.

===== Compiling =====

If you don't want to compile the plugin yourself, download the binary
from the link above.

The easiest way to compile this plugin is to download the Atlassian
SDK and simply type "atlas-package". Alternatively, use "atlas-run" to
automatically run a Confluence instance with the plugin installed
(uses a development licensed Confluence). Different versions of
Confluence can be tried using "atlas-run --version 3.5.13".

The src/main/resources/mathjax directory contains a pristine copy of
MathJax v1.1a. It can be updated as necessary to newer versions of
MathJax as and when they are released, provided that the configuration
mechanism does not change from version to version.

**Note:** MathJax itself is not included in the source repository. (It is
  included in the binary however.) Simply download it from
  <http://www.mathjax.org/> and unpack in the appropriate directory. MathJax.js
  should end up as src/main/resources/mathjax/MathJax.js.
